1. Follow these steps to connect to heroku's database locally

##### PROBLEMS #####
1. In production settings (locally), for whatever reason, I have no database connection. Get errors. --> FIXED.
2. Can't find static files once I can actually connect with no errors (Django Admin static files are found) --> FIXED
3. Problems with WhiteNoiseStaticFilesStorage. Check troubleshooting on site (http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/django.html) -> Removing django static file app solves issue???
4. BASE_DIR seems to be wrong --> FIXED
5. Text about no available posts shows up when I have < 3 posts (blog/index.html)
6. Make API more secure (use their authentication) --> DONE (not use in prod)
7. Create superuser for production --> DONE
8. Create 404 page --> DONE
9. Set up HTTPS
10. Buildpack error -- FIXED (was committing wrong branch)
11. Can't scale my app to have one dyno running. Might be something with location of Procfile? But if I move it, I get a buuuuunch of problems. Running `heroku ps:scale web=1` doesn't work, gives error. --> FIXED
12. Try getting GitHub webhooks to work (https://developer.github.com/webhooks/configuring/)
13. Add options to development to run with debug=False, and do it for static files 'n stuff
14. Having problem with static files 404 error on live deployment -- FIXED (adding STATICFILES_FINDERS fixed it???? Removing COLLECTSTATIC = 1 as config var)
15. If I change repo stuff on Admin site, create process to send that info to GitHub to update the repo(s)
16. Pass info from password reset to see if password_reset_complete should direct to normal login, or admin login. Use session??? Middleware??

      * I have my Registration app in INSTALLED_APPS included after admin, so the admin templates/urls are used
      * https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/admin/#adminsite-objects
17. Use timezone-aware fields? Real confusing
  - Store datetimes in UTC in database. Convert to timezone when putting data to client
18. AboutContent is only loaded on homepage/index, not on any other pages. What to do? --> FIXED
19. Update "Recent Actions" in admin site with actions performed not exclusively from admin site
  * https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/admin/#logentry-objects
  * https://django-simple-history.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
20. Webhook seems to not be updating??? Says it is though. Pushed at time is an hour behind
21. Shouldn't be able to add Repository objects in admin site - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.add_view
22. Add more resume info. Add resume as a file!
23. Cache sheeet doesn't work. Look at caches more
